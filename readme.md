# Project Description

This project is a comprehensive backend application built using modern web technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Bcrypt, and cloudinary among others. It serves as the backend for a fully functional video hosting platform with features comparable to popular platforms like YouTube. 


# Key Features

* User Authentication and Authorization:
  * Secure login and signUp functionality using JWT for access tokens and refresh tokens.
  * Password hashing and validation using Bcrypt for enhanced security.

* Video Management:
  * Upload, update, and delete videos with support for cloud storage.
  * Fetch all videos, videos by user, or a single video by ID.
  * Toggle video publish status.

* Interaction Features:
  * Like and dislike videos and comments.
  * Add, edit, and delete comments and replies.
  * Fetch video comments with pagination.

* Subscription System:
  * Subscribe to channels and unsubscribe when desired.
  * Manage and fetch subscriptions.
  * Standard Practices:

* Utilization of JWT for session management.
  * Implementation of middleware for request validation and user authentication.
  * Error handling with a structured API error response system.
  * Use of async/await and custom async handlers for clean and efficient asynchronous operations.

* Efficient use of MongoDB queries and Mongoose methods.


This project represents a complete backend solution for a modern video hosting platform. It is the result of careful planning, design, and implementation, offering a great opportunity to learn and understand backend development standards and practices.
